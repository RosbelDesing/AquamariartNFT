                            I consider that I do not have a personal style as an artist, I am constantly changing as a result of my learning process. I've been through several stages
                            where my style varied from manga to portraits, but the central axis of my illustrations has always been women. The biggest change in my style happened along with my entry into the world of NFTs just 3 months ago, where I have since decided to dedicate myself more seriously to illustration.
